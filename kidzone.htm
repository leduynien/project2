            <h2>What is the HighScope educational model?</h2>
            <p>
                The HighScope educational model emphasizes “individual active learning”. Active learning means that
                students have first-hand experiences with people, things, events, and ideas. Children's interests and
                choices are at the heart of the HighScope program. <br><br>

                Children build their own knowledge through interactions with the world and people around them. Children
                take the first step in the learning process through making choices and implementing their plans and
                decisions. Teachers, caregivers, and parents provide children with emotional, material, and intellectual
                support. In active learning, adults open up children's minds through diverse interactions of materials
                and care. Through “racks,” adults help children gain knowledge and develop creative problem-solving
                skills. <br><br>
