                Your child's first experiences of school are the key to laying the foundation for a successful learning
                journey. It is therefore crucial that these early experiences are positive and developmentally
                appropriate.

                Run by our highly specialized teachers, the Early Years program in ISSP delivers a balanced curriculum
                that focuses on the development of both the interpersonal and academic skills of the child. It is
                well-aligned with our dominant pedagogy which is the IB PYP Framework, the Reggio Emilia-inspired
                teaching and learning approach bespoke to our school. <br><br>
            </p>

        <h3>The Early Years in the IB PYP</h3>
        <p>
            At ISSP, quality learning experiences during the early years are supported through the IB PYP's
            constructivist and social constructivist approach to learning. <br><br>

            The PYP transdisciplinary framework is designed to support the development of key cognitive and social
            emotional abilities for Early Years students, through play and student-led learning engagements. <br><br>

            Whilst, inquiring through play in the early years supports the notion that learning is an active process.
            Healthy learning environments and supportive relationships further support this learning process.

            <h2>Admission process of Saigon Pearl International School:</h2>
            <h4>STEP 1</h4>
            Parents will first need to complete the Online Application Form and send all required documents via email:
            admissions@issp.edu.vn. All required forms, fees and paperwork must be submitted before an application can
            be considered for admission. Applications will be reviewed in chronological order. Please see the list of
            required documents below the page. <br> <br>

            <h4>STEP 2</h4>
            Once the application is received and the registration fee is received from the parent, the Admissions Office
            will review the application. The school may ask for more information about your child from your child's
            family or previous school. The school will then contact the family to schedule an age assessment with the
            School Board, followed by an interview. Next, the family will be notified of whether the child meets the
            criteria for admission.
            <br><br>
            <h4>STEP 3</h4>
            Once your child has been admitted to school, parents need to complete the Medical Examination Form and
            return it to the school prior to the child's start date. <br><br>
